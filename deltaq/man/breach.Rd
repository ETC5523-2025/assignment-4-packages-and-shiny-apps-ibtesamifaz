\description{
Simulated 7-day quarantine breach rate data across Australian states and territories,
based on the modelling by Zachreson et al. (2022).
}
\details{
This dataset includes raw simulated data showing the 7-day breach rates of COVID-19
(or other potential viruses) within Australian quarantine systems. It provides
state-level and national-level daily observations of breach probabilities under
different quarantine system configurations.

The data was extracted from sheet 9 of \code{data-raw/covid.xlsx}, which is derived
from simulations presented in Zachreson et al. (2022). The original study is available
at \url{https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abm3624}.

This dataset can be used to analyse the susceptibility of any virus given the
quarantine systems implemented across different Australian jurisdictions.
