\title{deltaq: Exploring Quarantine Breach Data}
\description{
The \strong{deltaq} package provides access to simulated 7-day quarantine breach rate data
for Australia and its states and territories (October 2020 – July 2021),
based on the modelling by Zachreson et al. (2022).
}
\details{
The goal of this package is to provide simulated breach rates that allow users
to explore how susceptible each state or territory — and Australia overall —
may be to viral incursions under varying quarantine system conditions.

In addition to the data, the package includes an interactive Shiny dashboard
for exploring jurisdictional differences and temporal trends in quarantine breach risk.
A vignette is also available to demonstrate how to use both the dataset and the app
for analysis.
