# deltaq

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The deltaq package provides data and interactive tools for exploring the dynamics of COVID-19 outbreaks in Australia during the Delta variant period.
It is based on the work by Zachreson et al. (2022), which modelled the efficacy of vaccines and quarantine systems under the Delta variant using simulation techniques.

The package includes:

📊 A dataset containing simulated quarantine breaches, overseas cases, and arrivals across Australian states between 27 October 2020 and 22 April 2021.

💡 A Shiny app (included in the package) that allows users to interactively explore outbreak data, visualize state differences, and simulate quarantine scenarios.

📚 Full documentation and reproducible examples for data exploration and visualization.

This package aims to make Zachreson et al.’s data and findings more accessible for teaching, research, and interactive communication.

## Installation
To install the development version from GitHub:

Option 1: using remotes
install.packages("remotes")



remotes::install_github(
"ETC5523-2025/assignment-4-packages-and-shiny-apps-ibtesamifaz",
subdir = "deltaq", build_vignettes = TRUE
)

Option 2: using pak
install.packages("pak")



pak::pak("ETC5523-2025/assignment-4-packages-and-shiny-apps-ibtesamifaz")

## Example

Load the package and explore the data:


library(deltaq)
head(deltaq_data)
summary(deltaq_data)



You can also launch the interactive Shiny app included in the package:


deltaq::run_app()


## About the data 

The dataset provided within deltaq is a cleaned and formatted version of simulation outputs from
Zachreson et al. (2022), Model-informed risk assessment for COVID-19 quarantine systems under the Delta variant.
It contains daily records of:

Simulated quarantine breaches

Overseas-acquired cases

Traveller arrivals

State identifiers and date range (27 Oct 2020 – 22 Apr 2021)

These data were used to evaluate how well quarantine systems performed against imported Delta infections.
