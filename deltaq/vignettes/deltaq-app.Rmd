## Overview

The deltaq package provides access to simulated 7-day quarantine breach rate data for Australia and its states and territories, covering 27 October 2020 â€“ 31 July 2021.

The included DeltaQ: Breach Data Explorer Shiny app offers an intuitive visualisation of breach rates across jurisdictions. It enables you to:

- Compare breach rate trends between states and territories side-by-side.

- Select any combination of states for focused comparison.

- Filter the date range between 27 October 2020 and 31 July 2021 to zoom into specific periods.

- This makes it easy to see where and when jurisdictions were more susceptible to breaches.

## Launching the app

The app is packaged with deltaq and can be launched directly:
  
Launch the Shiny app (interactive)

**deltaq::launch_app()**

Use the controls to pick multiple jurisdictions and narrow the date window. The main panel shows daily breach-rate time series; a short guide below the plot summarises how each state changed.


## Data used by the app
The app uses deltaq::breach, with REPORT_DATE plus one numeric column per jurisdiction (breach rate per day).

- library(deltaq)
- data("breach")
- str(breach)
